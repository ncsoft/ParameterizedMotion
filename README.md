# ParameterizedMotion

This code implements the paper Learning a family of motor skills from a single motion clip. 
This system learns parameterized motor skills from a single motion clip in physics simulation. 
Our algorithm can automatically spatio-temporally edit the given motion clip to satisfy given the task space. 
This code is written in C++ and Python, based on Tensorflow2 and DartSim.

This opensource is a collaboration between Seoul National University and NCSOFT.
